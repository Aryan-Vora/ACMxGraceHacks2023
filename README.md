# Project Setup README

## Frontend Setup
To set up the frontend part of the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm i
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Backend Setup
For setting up the backend, these are the steps to follow:

1. Switch to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm i
   ```
3. Launch the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
## API Setup
For setting up the api, these are the steps to follow:

1. Switch to the ml directory:
   ```
   cd ml
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip3 install
   ```
3. Launch the development server(defaults to port 5000):
   ```
   python3 -m flask --app api run
   ```

That's all you need to get both the frontend and backend up and running for development. Remember to have Node.js installed before beginning with these steps.
